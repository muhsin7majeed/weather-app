# weather-app

demo : https://muhsin7majeed.github.io/weather-app/

I made this Weather-App to learn react-js. This is just a simple web-app that fetches weather details from Dark Sky Api. I tried to add a search field, but couldn't find a FREE api to get location details ( google maps api throws 'request limit reached ' error :p). So, now this app only shows weather for your current location. (That too is not accurate :( ) Also it has a problem with getting geolocation of mobile devices.
